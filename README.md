# React Netflix Clone

A fully responsive Netflix-inspired web application built using **React (Vite)**, **Tailwind CSS**, **Firebase**, and **The Movie Database (TMDB) API**.  
This project replicates core Netflix features, including **real-time movie data fetching**, **secure user authentication**, and a **modern, mobile-first UI**.  

It is designed for learning purposes and to demonstrate how to integrate Firebase authentication, TMDB API, and responsive UI design in a React project.
